# LED_CHIP
CHIP 8 emulator that runs on an LED matrix

Just a quick little project to break into emulation and thought I'd do something a bit different. It's not that polished, the weird control inputs and janky nature of the CHIP 8 mean I probably won't take it any further, but it's a cool little application.   

I used this guide, including some of the code: https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/
